## IMPORTANT ##
#
# Usually a pattern here also belongs in your `.gitignore` file and vice versa.
#
# Note that Docker's ignore syntax is slightly different to Git's. The main
# difference is that Git interprets patterns without a leading slash as applying
# to any subdirectory, while Docker interprets them as relative to the project
# root directory. To resolve that, a `.dockerignore` should prefix those
# patterns with `**/`. This is also compatible with Git.
#
# This file is NOT a substitute for being intentional in copying directories to
# a Docker image. Avoid use of `COPY . <destination>` in your `Dockerfile`s.
#
## How to use this file
#
# Add patterns to the section they apply to, sorted by:
#
#   1. absolute paths to or patterns for files (with a `/` prefix)
#   2. absolute paths to or patterns for directories
#   3. relative paths to or patterns for files (with a `**/` prefix)
#   4. relative paths to or patterns for directories
#   5. pattern exceptions (sorted as above)
#
# Sort them alphanumerically within each section.
#
# If no section fits, create one. No path or pattern should exist without a
# section or label.
#

## Sensitive files
#
# Note that these patterns will ignore any files matched by their equivalents in
# `.gitignore`. This is probably what you want in many cases, but you may need
# to add exceptions here if you really want to include them in your Docker
# images. An exception is a more specific pattern (ideally a fully specified
# path without any wildcards) prefixed with a `!` and must be defined after the
# pattern it's excepting (which will happen naturally if you're following the
# sort order above).
